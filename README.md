# RAD - Hi-Tech Admin Portal frontend - ReactJS

This is a project done for RAD - Rapid Application Development in MSc year 1 semester 2, where this React web application servers as a part of a complete system. This system is used for management of containers in shipping ports used by company Admins to accept or reject containers based on the inspection data submitted by the driver. The driver inspects the container's external condition, looking for any visible damages, signs of corrosion, or structural issues and submit the data to Admin to confirm. If the admin decides to approve, then the driver leave with the container and otherwise not. The application is developed using ReactJS and connected to a backend.
